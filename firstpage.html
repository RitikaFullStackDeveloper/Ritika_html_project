        <p>Paheli (translation: Riddle) is a 2005 Indian Hindi-language fantasy film and is a remake of the 1973
            Hindi
            film
            Duvidha by Mani Kaul based on the short story written by Vijayadan Detha in Rajasthani. It was also
            reported
            to
            have been partially inspired by the 1997 Kannada movie Nagamandala based on the play of same name by
            Girish
            Karnad.[2] Directed by Amol Palekar and produced by Juhi Chawla, Aziz Mirza, Sanjiv Chawla, and Shah
            Rukh
            Khan,
            who also portrays the male lead, the film tells the story of a wife (Rani Mukerji) whose husband (Khan)
            goes
            on
            a business trip and is visited by a ghost, disguised as her husband, who is in love with her and takes
            her
            husband's place. The supporting cast includes Anupam Kher, Amitabh Bachchan, Juhi Chawla and Suniel
            Shetty.
            Detha's story, which had earlier been adapted into the 1973 film by Mani Kaul, is folkloric in
            origin.[3]
            Paheli
            diverges from its source material and the earlier adaptations in giving the plot and its lead female
            character a
            more feminist agency.[4]</p>

            villagers face the arduous task of learning a game that is alien to them and play for a victory.</p>
